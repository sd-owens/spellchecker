# Spell Checker
Implementation of a dynamic spell checker program using a hashmap data structure written in C programming language.  
Searches for correct word spelling based on the the current Oxford English dictionary and provides a list of five
possible alternatives if the spelling is found to be correct.  Implementation is based on a bucket type hashing function
and underlying linked list data structure resulting in O(n) performance.
